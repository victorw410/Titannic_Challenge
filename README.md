# Titannic_Challenge

From the Kaggle Titanic challenge where we use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I have tried 5 different classification models: LogisticRegression, KNN, SVM, GaussianNB, and Decision Tree with all the features for X and only 2 features with Sex & Pclass.
Overall, with all the x features, LogisticRegression and SVM with linear kernel perform the best with an accurate rate of around 82%. When using only 2 features( Sex & Pclass), all the models returns with the same accuracy rate of 82.4%
The result matches the research paper from https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.09851.pdf which states that Sex is the most important feature for survival
